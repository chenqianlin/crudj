This file can be opened in Windows Notebook.<br />
**1. The first row, started with the "companTittle", show the tittle, which will be shown on the IE tittle when you open the web site. It will be shown on the top of the index page in the web site.**<br />
**2. The second row, started with the "charset",is the characterset which will be used by crudj to read business model files(.dsl as the file extension). The example was writen in Chinese, so it was set to GBK. If your computer use other language,just change it accordingly.** <br />
**3. The program type row is used to designate the app type which will be generated by crudj. In version 1.0, this parameter should be "web", can't be changed. In the future vesion, it will be expanded to other type. For example, if program type equals "desktop", crudj will generate the desktop app instead of web app. This parameter will be also used to set the subtype of the target app which will be generated by crudj.** <br />
**4. The destSrcPath row set the address of source code and binary files generated by crudj. This path should be absolute. If it is not exist, crudj will create it first during the file generating. Cudj also can recognize the file separator used by different operation systems.
Whether "/" or "\" you used in the path is not a problem, crudj will change it to the right one automaticly.** <br />
**5. The destClassPackage row set the class packages of source code generated by crudj. This  is not the important thing. But if you treat source code as asset of your company, then the class pacakge named with your company is a good clarification.** <br />
**6. The last four rows are about database driver. If they are blank, the default database type will be used. That is memory type database in version 1.0. The dbDriver row should be filled with a JDBC driver name supplied by the database suplier.The dbConnectString is the database server address, used by the JDBC driver. The dbUser and dbPassword is used when we exchange data with database. This user should have table create/alert and data insert/delete authority.** <br />
